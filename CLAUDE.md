# LabWeave Project Context

## Important Documents to Reference

Always consult these core documents when discussing LabWeave implementation:

- `/Users/scotthandley/Code/labweave/instructions/labweave-overview.md` - Project vision, goals, and transformative impact
- `/Users/scotthandley/Code/labweave/instructions/labweave-prompt.md` - Detailed implementation requirements and development approach
- `/Users/scotthandley/Code/labweave/instructions/tech-stack.md` - Technology stack decisions and architecture
- `/Users/scotthandley/Code/labweave/instructions/mvp-plan.md` - MVP roadmap focusing on knowledge management â†’ LIMS â†’ AI
- `/Users/scotthandley/Code/labweave/instructions/api-design.md` - RESTful API design patterns and endpoints
- `/Users/scotthandley/Code/labweave/instructions/phase1-implementation.md` - Current implementation progress tracker
- `/Users/scotthandley/Code/labweave/instructions/python-compatibility-analysis.md` - Python version requirements and analysis
- `/Users/scotthandley/Code/labweave/instructions/development-setup-guide.md` - Developer environment setup instructions

### Document Relationships

- **labweave-prompt.md**: Serves as the stable requirements document defining WHAT to build
- **tech-stack.md**: Details HOW to build it with specific technology choices
- **CLAUDE.md**: Captures CURRENT FOCUS and implementation priorities
- **phase1-implementation.md**: Tracks actual implementation progress and blockers
- **development-setup-guide.md**: Practical instructions for getting started

The prompt remains the north star for requirements while other documents capture evolving implementation decisions.

## Project Guidelines

### Current Focus
- **Domain**: Omics research (specifically metagenomics/Illumina data)
- **Scale**: Initial deployment for 8-12 users per lab  
- **Phase**: Focus on Phase 1 (Foundation with Basic Intelligence) from the overview
- **Architecture**: Single lab deployment initially (but designed for future multi-tenancy)

### Development Priorities
1. Knowledge Management first (document CRUD, basic knowledge graph) âœ…
2. LIMS functionality second (sample tracking, metagenomics focus) ðŸŸ¨
3. AI features last (after core functionality is stable)
4. PubMed integration as primary external knowledge source
5. Calendar integration for shared equipment/facilities (Cal.com preferred)
6. Frontend development in parallel with backend (now active)

### Known Issues & Solutions
- **Python 3.13 Compatibility**: Use Python 3.11.x until ecosystem catches up
- **Database Setup**: Ensure Docker services are running before starting backend
- **Import Errors**: Always activate virtual environment before running code

### Technology Decisions
- **Python Version**: 3.11.x (3.13 not yet supported due to ecosystem compatibility)
- **Backend**: Python/FastAPI with PostgreSQL and Neo4j
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **AI/ML**: PyTorch locally + OpenAI/Claude/Gemini APIs
- **Omics Tools**: Biopython, BioBERT, RDKit for domain-specific needs
- **Development Tools**: Black, Ruff, pytest for code quality

### What NOT to Focus On (Yet)
- Mobile/field work capabilities (see `/future-ideas/mobile-field-work.md`)
- Multi-lab federation (Phase 3 feature)
- Regulatory compliance frameworks
- Petabyte-scale data handling

### Development Approach
1. Start with core functionality before advanced features
2. Use modular architecture for easy extension
3. Implement automated testing during development
4. Design APIs first for frontend-backend separation
5. Keep security in mind but don't over-engineer initially
6. Git repository: https://github.com/shandley/labweave
7. Use Python 3.11 for compatibility and stability
8. Iterate quickly with basic tests for MVP, comprehensive testing post-concept validation
9. Maintain comprehensive documentation as we build

### File Format Support (Omics Data)
Initial support planned for:
- Sequencing data: FASTQ, FASTA, SAM, BAM
- Analysis outputs: Count tables, taxonomy tables
- Phylogenetic data: Tree files (Newick, Nexus)
- Architecture designed for easy format expansion

### File Organization
- `/instructions/` - Core project documentation
- `/backend/src/` - Backend source code (FastAPI application)
- `/backend/tests/` - Backend test files
- `/frontend/src/` - Frontend source code (React application)
- `/infrastructure/docker/` - Docker compose and infrastructure configs
- `/docs/` - API and user documentation (to be created)
- `/future-ideas/` - Features for later consideration

## Development Tips

### Environment Setup
```bash
cd backend
./setup-dev.sh  # Use our automated setup script
```

### Smart Development Workflow (NEW - Recommended)
```bash
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate

# Option 1: Automated startup with all checks and fixes
python smart_start.py

# Option 2: Using make commands
make smart-start     # Runs all checks, fixes, and starts server
make check          # Run pre-flight checks only
make fix           # Run automated fixes only
make test          # Run test suite
```

### Automated Testing System
We now have a comprehensive automated testing and fixing system:
- **smart_start.py**: Runs all checks, applies fixes, documentation updates, and starts server
- **preflight_check.py**: Validates code structure before startup
- **automated_fix.py**: Detects and fixes common errors automatically
- **tests/test_startup.py**: Comprehensive startup validation tests
- **AUTOMATED_TESTING.md**: Full documentation of the system

### Automatic Documentation Management (NEW)
The project now includes an automatic documentation management system that runs with smart_start.py:
- **doc_manager.py**: Basic documentation update system with change detection
- **doc_manager_advanced.py**: Advanced system with semantic code analysis
- **Auto-updated files**:
  - `CLAUDE.md`: Implementation status, known issues, priorities
  - `instructions/phase1-implementation.md`: Progress tracking
  - `docs/api/endpoints.md`: API documentation (when endpoints exist)

The documentation manager automatically:
- Detects code changes (new models, endpoints, tests)
- Updates implementation status sections
- Tracks test coverage and failures
- Identifies TODO/FIXME items in code
- Updates progress timestamps
- Generates API documentation from code

To run documentation updates manually:
```bash
cd backend
python doc_manager.py  # Basic updates
python doc_manager_advanced.py  # Full semantic analysis
```

The system maintains a `doc_config.json` file to track file hashes and monitor changes between runs.

### Manual Testing
```bash
pytest  # Run all tests
pytest -v  # Verbose output
pytest --cov=src  # With coverage
pytest tests/test_startup.py  # Run startup validation tests
```

### Code Quality
```bash
black .  # Format code
ruff check .  # Lint code
mypy .  # Type checking
```

## Remember
- LabWeave aims to be transformative, not just another ELN/LIMS
- Focus on scientist-friendly UX over technical complexity
- The platform should adapt to researchers, not vice versa
- AI should augment human intelligence, not replace it
- Always test with realistic scientific workflows
