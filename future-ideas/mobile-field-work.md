# LabWeave Mobile & Field Work Features (Future Development)

## Overview
While the initial LabWeave implementation focuses on desktop/web interfaces for laboratory environments, future versions could benefit from mobile and field work capabilities.

## Potential Mobile Features

### 1. Offline Data Collection
- Sync experimental data when connectivity is restored
- Local storage of protocols and methods
- Queue sample registrations for later processing

### 2. Field Sample Collection
- GPS tagging for sample locations
- Photo capture with automatic metadata
- Voice notes with transcription
- Barcode/QR code scanning

### 3. Quick Data Entry
- Simplified interfaces for common tasks
- Voice-to-text for observations
- Template-based data collection
- Real-time validation

### 4. Equipment Integration
- Bluetooth connectivity to portable instruments
- Direct data import from field equipment
- QR code scanning for equipment check-in/out

## Technical Considerations

### Framework Options
- **React Native**: Share code with web frontend
- **Flutter**: High performance cross-platform
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Minimal development overhead

### Offline Capabilities
- Service workers for offline functionality
- Local database (SQLite, Realm)
- Conflict resolution for data sync
- Compressed data storage

### Security
- Biometric authentication
- Encrypted local storage
- Secure data transmission
- Remote wipe capabilities

## Use Cases

1. **Environmental Sampling**
   - Field researchers collecting samples
   - Real-time data logging
   - Chain of custody tracking

2. **Clinical Research**
   - Patient sample collection
   - Bedside data entry
   - Protocol compliance checking

3. **Remote Facilities**
   - Satellite labs with poor connectivity
   - Field stations
   - Mobile research units

## Implementation Priority
To be considered after core platform stability and based on user demand.
