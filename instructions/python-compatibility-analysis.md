# Python Compatibility Analysis for LabWeave

## Issue Summary

During initial backend setup, we encountered compatibility issues with Python 3.13 and several key dependencies:

1. **psycopg2-binary**: Failed to install due to missing pg_config
2. **pydantic-core**: Build failed during Rust compilation
3. General ecosystem readiness for Python 3.13

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Python 3.13 Release Timeline
- Python 3.13 is either very recently released or still in pre-release
- Many package maintainers haven't yet released pre-compiled wheels
- The ecosystem typically takes 3-6 months to fully support new Python versions

### 2. Specific Package Issues

#### psycopg2-binary
- Attempting to build from source instead of using pre-compiled binaries
- Pre-compiled wheels not yet available for Python 3.13
- This is a temporary issue that will resolve once maintainers release new wheels

#### pydantic/pydantic-core
- Uses Rust for performance-critical parts
- Requires compilation during installation if no wheel is available
- Complex build process that's sensitive to Python version changes

### 3. Ecosystem Dependencies
Our tech stack relies on mature packages:
- FastAPI (depends on pydantic)
- SQLAlchemy (stable across Python versions)
- Various scientific libraries (numpy, pandas, biopython)

## Impact on Future Development

### Short-term (Next 1-3 months)
- ✅ **No significant impact** - Use Python 3.11 or 3.12
- ✅ All our dependencies fully support these versions
- ✅ Code written is forward-compatible

### Medium-term (3-6 months)
- ✅ Python 3.13 support will improve dramatically
- ✅ Most packages will release compatible versions
- ✅ Can upgrade Python version without code changes

### Long-term (6+ months)
- ✅ Python 3.13 will be fully supported ecosystem-wide
- ✅ Performance improvements in 3.13 will benefit the project
- ✅ No technical debt from version choice

## Recommended Strategy

### 1. Immediate Action
```bash
# Use Python 3.11 for development
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Development Environment
- Standardize on Python 3.11.x for all developers
- Document this requirement in README
- Use pyenv or similar tool for version management

### 3. Version Management
```python
# In setup.py or pyproject.toml
python_requires=">=3.11,<3.13"
```

### 4. CI/CD Configuration
```yaml
# .github/workflows/tests.yml
strategy:
  matrix:
    python-version: [3.11, 3.12]
```

### 5. Monitoring and Updates
- Watch for dependency updates supporting 3.13
- Test periodically with newer Python versions
- Upgrade when ecosystem is ready (likely Q2 2024)

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Stability**: Python 3.11 is battle-tested and stable
2. **Compatibility**: All scientific packages fully support it
3. **Performance**: Still get significant improvements over older versions
4. **Future-proof**: Code will work with future Python versions
5. **Developer Experience**: No compatibility issues during development

## Specific Recommendations for LabWeave

1. **Update requirements.txt**:
   ```txt
   # Specify Python version requirement
   # Requires Python >=3.11,<3.13
   ```

2. **Create .python-version file**:
   ```
   3.11.7
   ```

3. **Update README.md**:
   ```markdown
   ## Requirements
   - Python 3.11.x (3.13 not yet supported due to dependency compatibility)
   ```

4. **Set up development script**:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   # setup-dev.sh
   if ! command -v python3.11 &> /dev/null; then
       echo "Python 3.11 is required. Please install it first."
       exit 1
   fi
   python3.11 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Conclusion

The Python 3.13 compatibility issue is:
- **Temporary**: Will resolve naturally as ecosystem updates
- **Not blocking**: Can use Python 3.11 without any limitations
- **Common**: Happens with every new Python release
- **Manageable**: Standard practice to wait for ecosystem readiness

This will not cause problems with future development. The scientific Python ecosystem is mature and handles version transitions well. By the time LabWeave reaches production readiness, Python 3.13 will be fully supported.
