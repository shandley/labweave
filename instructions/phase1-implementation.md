## Daily Progress Notes

### Date: Initial Setup
- Initialized project structure
- Set up development environment
- Created tracking documentation
- Initialized Git repository and pushed to GitHub

### Current Progress  
- Created complete backend structure with FastAPI
- Implemented database models for User, Project, Experiment, Protocol, Sample, and Document
- Set up authentication endpoints with JWT
- Created CRUD endpoints for all entities
- Implemented test framework with comprehensive tests
- Resolved Python compatibility issues by using Python 3.11.x
- Implemented comprehensive automated testing and startup system
- Created smart_start.py for one-command development workflow
- Added pre-flight validation and automated fixing capabilities
- Implemented document management with versioning and file uploads
- Successfully integrated Neo4j for knowledge graph
- Built complete frontend application with React/TypeScript
- Implemented authentication flow and protected routes
- Created responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Built Projects page with full CRUD functionality
- Created Dashboard with usage statistics
- Set up state management with TanStack Query

### Date: Frontend Development (2025-05-17)
- Initialized React frontend with TypeScript and Vite
- Set up routing with React Router
- Implemented authentication context with JWT
- Created API service layer for backend communication
- Built login/register pages with form validation
- Created dashboard with statistics
- Implemented Projects page with full CRUD operations
- Set up responsive navigation layout
- Configured Tailwind CSS for styling
- Integrated TanStack Query for data fetching

## Blockers & Issues
- ✅ RESOLVED: Python 3.13 compatibility issues (using Python 3.11.x)
- ✅ RESOLVED: Neo4j integration (now complete)
- ⬜ Some frontend pages still need implementation (Experiments, Samples, etc.)
- ⬜ File upload UI not yet implemented in frontend
- ⬜ Knowledge graph visualization needs to be built

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining frontend pages (Experiments, Samples, Documents, Protocols)
2. Implement file upload UI for omics data
3. Add knowledge graph visualization component
4. Improve error handling and user feedback
5. Implement search functionality
6. Add data export/import features
7. Create comprehensive user documentation
8. Set up automated testing for frontend
9. Implement real-time updates for collaborative features

## Development Strategy Update
- Rapid iteration for MVP with basic tests
- Comprehensive testing post-concept validation
- Focus on PostgreSQL features first, then Neo4j integration
- Support multiple omics file formats (FASTQ, FASTA, SAM, BAM, count tables, taxonomy tables, phylogenetic trees)
- Frontend development begins after backend MVP completion
- File storage using filesystem with PostgreSQL path references
- Dedicated /api/v1/files/ endpoint for omics data handling
- NEW: Automated development workflow with smart_start.py
- NEW: Pre-flight validation catches issues before runtime
- NEW: Automated error fixing reduces debugging time

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All document CRUD operations working
- [ ] Basic knowledge graph populated
- [ ] User authentication functional
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] API documentation complete

## Notes
- Focus on clean architecture
- Write tests alongside implementation
- Document as we go
- Keep commits atomic and well-described
