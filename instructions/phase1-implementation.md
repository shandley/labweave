## Daily Progress Notes

### Date: Initial Setup
- Initialized project structure
- Set up development environment
- Created tracking documentation
- Initialized Git repository and pushed to GitHub

### Current Progress
- Created complete backend structure with FastAPI
- Implemented database models for User, Project, Experiment, Protocol, and Sample
- Set up authentication endpoints with JWT
- Created basic CRUD endpoints for users and projects
- Implemented test framework with initial tests
- Encountered Python compatibility issues with latest versions
- Implemented comprehensive automated testing and startup system
- Created smart_start.py for one-command development workflow
- Added pre-flight validation and automated fixing capabilities

## Blockers & Issues
- Python 3.13 compatibility issues with pydantic/psycopg2 (Solution: Use Python 3.11.x)
- User has not tested the implementation yet
- Neo4j integration not started

## Next Steps
1. User to test Python 3.11 environment setup using setup-dev.sh
2. Complete database connections (especially Neo4j)
3. Implement remaining CRUD endpoints
4. Add document management features with omics file support
5. Set up knowledge graph functionality

## Development Strategy Update
- Rapid iteration for MVP with basic tests
- Comprehensive testing post-concept validation
- Focus on PostgreSQL features first, then Neo4j integration
- Support multiple omics file formats (FASTQ, FASTA, SAM, BAM, count tables, taxonomy tables, phylogenetic trees)
- Frontend development begins after backend MVP completion
- File storage using filesystem with PostgreSQL path references
- Dedicated /api/v1/files/ endpoint for omics data handling
- NEW: Automated development workflow with smart_start.py
- NEW: Pre-flight validation catches issues before runtime
- NEW: Automated error fixing reduces debugging time

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All document CRUD operations working
- [ ] Basic knowledge graph populated
- [ ] User authentication functional
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] API documentation complete

## Notes
- Focus on clean architecture
- Write tests alongside implementation
- Document as we go
- Keep commits atomic and well-described
