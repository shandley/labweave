## Daily Progress Notes

### Date: Initial Setup
- Initialized project structure
- Set up development environment
- Created tracking documentation
- Initialized Git repository and pushed to GitHub

### Current Progress
- Created complete backend structure with FastAPI
- Implemented database models for User, Project, Experiment, Protocol, and Sample
- Set up authentication endpoints with JWT
- Created basic CRUD endpoints for users and projects
- Implemented test framework with initial tests
- Encountered Python compatibility issues with latest versions

## Blockers & Issues
- Python 3.13 compatibility issues with pydantic/psycopg2
- Need to set up proper Python environment with compatible versions

## Next Steps
1. Set up Python 3.11 environment for better compatibility
2. Complete database connections (especially Neo4j)
3. Implement remaining CRUD endpoints
4. Add document management features
5. Set up knowledge graph functionality

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All document CRUD operations working
- [ ] Basic knowledge graph populated
- [ ] User authentication functional
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage
- [ ] API documentation complete

## Notes
- Focus on clean architecture
- Write tests alongside implementation
- Document as we go
- Keep commits atomic and well-described
