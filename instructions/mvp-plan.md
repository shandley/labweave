# LabWeave MVP Plan

## Overview

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for LabWeave focuses on establishing the core knowledge management infrastructure with basic metagenomics support.

## MVP Phases

### Phase 1: Knowledge Management Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

**Core Features:**
1. **Document Management**
   - Create/Read/Update/Delete protocols and experiments
   - Markdown-based documentation with metadata
   - Basic version control
   - File attachments (FASTQ, FASTA support)

2. **Basic Knowledge Graph**
   - Entity extraction (samples, experiments, protocols)
   - Simple relationship mapping
   - Visualization of connections

3. **User Interface**
   - Dashboard with recent activity
   - Document editor with preview
   - Basic search functionality

**Technical Goals:**
- FastAPI backend with basic CRUD operations
- PostgreSQL for structured data
- Neo4j for relationships
- React frontend with Material-UI

### Phase 2: Metagenomics Focus (Weeks 3-4)

**Domain-Specific Features:**
1. **Sample Management**
   - Sample registration and tracking
   - Metadata capture (source, date, conditions)
   - Processing pipeline tracking

2. **Sequencing Data Support**
   - FASTQ file upload and storage
   - Basic quality metrics display
   - Link sequences to samples/experiments

3. **Analysis Integration**
   - Store analysis results
   - Link tools/parameters to outputs
   - Basic visualization of results

**Technical Goals:**
- MinIO integration for file storage
- Basic BioPython integration
- Simple data visualization

### Phase 3: Enhanced Knowledge Features (Weeks 5-6)

**Advanced Features:**
1. **Smart Search**
   - Full-text search across documents
   - Filter by entity type
   - Timeline view of experiments

2. **Collaboration**
   - Multi-user support
   - Basic permissions (read/write)
   - Activity feed

3. **External Integration**
   - PubMed reference import
   - Basic citation management
   - Link internal work to publications

**Technical Goals:**
- Elasticsearch integration
- JWT authentication
- PubMed API integration

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- Users can create and manage experimental protocols
- System tracks metagenomics samples through workflow
- Knowledge graph shows relationships between entities
- Search finds relevant information quickly

### Technical Requirements
- Clean API design with OpenAPI documentation
- 80%+ test coverage for core features
- Docker-based development environment
- Database migrations set up properly

### User Experience
- Scientists can document experiments faster than current methods
- Finding related experiments/protocols is intuitive
- System adapts to existing workflows

## Non-Goals for MVP

- Complex AI features (hypothesis generation, predictions)
- Advanced LIMS features (inventory, equipment scheduling)
- Mobile interface
- Multi-lab federation
- Regulatory compliance features

## Development Priorities

1. **Core Infrastructure**: Database schema, API structure, authentication
2. **Knowledge Management**: Document CRUD, basic knowledge graph
3. **Metagenomics Support**: Sample tracking, file handling
4. **User Interface**: Clean, functional UI for core features
5. **Search & Discovery**: Make information findable

## Next Steps After MVP

Based on user feedback, prioritize:
1. AI-powered features (entity extraction, suggestions)
2. Advanced LIMS capabilities
3. More sophisticated analysis integration
4. Enhanced collaboration features
